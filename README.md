## Our Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to introduce you to the core programming concepts that will form the foundation of most of the apps you’ll build in the future. This app will teach you a lot of important programming knowledge, while building a neat Mood check, or dice app.

## What you will create

You will be making your first musical instrument! Music apps are so popular on the App Store that they even get their own category. So in this module, we’re going to make a colourful XyloPhone app.

## What you will learn

- How to play sound using AVFoundation and AVAudioPlayer.
- Understand Apple documentation and how to use StackOverflow.
- Functions and methods in Swift.
- Data types.
- Swift loops.
- Variable scope.
- The ViewController lifecycle.
- Error handling in Swift.
- Code refactoring.
- Basic debugging.
